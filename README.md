### Main Components

| Component | Silkprint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCU | SYN2A-000 | Silkprint Customized Artery AT32F421C8T7 without Artery ISP bootloader (120MHz,64KByte Flash,16KByte SRAM) |
| RF | Beken BK4819 | |
| Flash | XMC 25QH16CJIG | 16Mbit |
| LCD | (unknown yet) | |

## Reverse Engineering
### 1). MCU pinout detetion

### 2). MCU part number detection over SWD

### 3). Bootloader binary dumping

At present, Flash Access Protection was enabled by default on the device's Flash, which means that the contents of the Flash cannot be read by code running in an environment other than Flash. This also makes it impossible to run the process of dumping Flash by loading the code into RAM.

The Flash was divided to 2 areas:
> 1. The first 4KBytes were for the Bootloader
> 2. The latter 60KBytes were used to store the Firmware.

The Bootloader was used to receive the encrypted firmware upgrade packages sent from the computer, and decrypt them before writing it to the firmware area of the Flash, which is starting from the address 0x08001000.

The firmware package was encrypted, but after research, I found that the first 2KBytes of the firmware may not be encrypted, so I tried to implement a firmware smaller than 2KByte. The only function was to read the the first 4KByte of Flash which storing Bootloader and send it out through the serial port on the K connector.

Dumped bootloader was placed at [reverse_engineering/dumped_btldr.bin](reverse_engineering/dumped_btldr.bin)

### 4). Bootloader reverse engineering for Firmware Upgrade Protocol and Encryption details

After the bootloader had dumped out, the details of the encryption algorithm in the bootloader were studied through Ghidra reverse engineering.

Then I prepared a group of sentences describing the algorithm details to Github Copilot, which helped me accurately generate the C language code of the encryption algorithm and the corresponding decryption code, refer to [reverse_engineering/encrypt.c](reverse_engineering/encrypt.c).

This can be used for firmware encryption and decryption, and also provides conditions for other partners who want to reverse engineer the complete firmware.

> About the .BF wrapping file format.
> First 16 bytes was for the header.
> | Offset | Length | Description |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 0x00 | 1 | Wrapped Region Count |
> | 0x01 | 4 | Region 1 Length, Encrypted firmware bin file length  |
> | 0x05 | 4 | Region 2 Length, Itâ€™s not clear yet. The guess is that it is related to the configuration. It will be clear after the Bootloader and Firmware are completely reverse engineered. |
> | 0x09 | 7 | No clear usage found, testing of random values seems no impact. |
> | 0x10 | Region 1 Length | Encrypted Firmware Bin Hex |
> | 0x10 + Region 1 Length | Region 2 Length | Configuration Hex? |

### 5). Factory firmware decryption and reverse engineering

### 6). Opensource Flashing Tool development
